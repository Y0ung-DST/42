# What is Libft?

Libft is an individual project at school 42 that requires us to implement some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be helpful for us in the next projects.

At 42 we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our codes, so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go farther in the program.
